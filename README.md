# SAVN - A Simulation Platform for Autonomous Vehicle Networks

SAVN is a simulation platform (in development) allowing researchers to visualize and benchmark traffic control algorithms for autonomous vehicle fleets.

The platform allows to test algorithms against real-world data such as popular origin/destination pairs and realistic traffic data (car, pedestrian, road hazards, etc.).
